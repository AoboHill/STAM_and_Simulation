# STAM_and_Simulation

## This repository provides the simulation R code for the STAM algorithm.

```
All of the STAM code is included in the STAM file folder.
```

```
For the simulation:

1. simulateSeq.R is to sample the sequences at tips using discrete WF

2. Simulation_MOM.R is to assess the error of moment approximation approach (also use discrete WF)
```

```
About the scaling:

r (number of the generations)
N (population size)
U (transition probability matrix)
Q (transition rate matrix)
I (identity matrix)

sclaing:

1. t = r/N

2. Q = (U - I)

```
